We would like to thank the organisers of the the DESC collaboration meetings at:
Stony Brook (July 2017), Oxford (July 2016), SLAC (March 2016), and ANL (2015), 
and the LSST-DESC Hack Week organisers (Ferminal, April 2017 \& CMU, November 2016), 
where this work was partly developed. We would also like to acknowledge the
contribution of the participants of the TJP Code Comparison Project, some of whom
are among the CCL contributors, for providing the benchmarks for 
testing CCL. We are grateful for the feedback received from
other working groups of DESC, including Strong Lensing, Supernovae, Large Scale
Structure and Photometric Redshifts.

Several of the junior DESC members are grateful for travel support from
LSST-DESC to attend DESC collaboration meetings and hack weeks.
EC acknowledges travel support for the SBU (2017) meeting 
provided by STFC for UK participation in LSST through grant ST/N002512/1.
