In this directory, there are direct
CLASS outputs ("ccl_*") that can be compared
to CCL splines ("PS*"). These are for linear
and nonlinear power spectra at z={0,3}.

The code one "ccl_power_converge.c" in
tests/ was used to produce the "PS*"
outputs.

The subdirectory "bilin" has CCL spectra
obtained with bilinear splines instead
of out fiducial bicubic.

The code psconverge.py produces all figures
for the comparison in the CCL note.
